- test timestamp handling
- handle can messages in interrupt for better timestamp accuracy
- validate windows drivers are installed automatically, at least when using USB_HS mode
- use usb tx complete callback to allow for parallel message handling on both channels
- do stress tests (real can traces, canoe)
- write a README, document everything
- make a linux test suite (connect can1 & can2 in hardware)
- implement can error handling

- implement error frame generation (how?)
- add our own usb protocol
